        <h2 class="title">Moving around the Sun</h2>
        <section class="maincontent span10"><p>Four months ago, in the middle of the year, the days were short. The nights were cold and the Sun was low in the middle of the day. We are in the fourth term now. The days are longer and the Sun is much higher in the middle of the day. Soon we will have summer. Then winter will come again. The seasons repeat every year We say that the seasons repeat in a cycle.</p>
        
        <p>A cycle is when things happen the same way, again and again. For example, do you remember learning about the water cycle in Term 2 in Matter and Materials? This is a cycle. Water evaporates from the oceans, lakes and rivers and becomes water vapour. Then the water vapour condenses and becomes liquid water again.</p>
        
        <p>Scientists explain why the seasons change in a cycle. They find that the Earth is moving around the Sun. Earth needs a year to go around the Sun once and come back to the same place. As the Earth moves around the Sun, we experience different seasons.</p>

          <p>The learners do not have to know about the tilt of the Earth's axis. The axis is tilted at 23\(\frac{1}{2}\) degrees from vertical. As a result, South Africa gets more sunshine when the Sun shines mostly on the southern hemisphere and less sunshine when the Sun shines mostly on the northern hemisphere. More sunshine means we have summer and less sunshine means we have winter.</p>

            <p>This is a demonstration, using two learners at a time. One learner must run with the ball to get it moving in a circle. You need plenty of room; at least a clear 10 metre diameter circle. The long string helps to give learners the correct idea that the Earth's orbit is at a very great radius from the Sun. Plan this to happen at the start or end of a period, because the learners take time to move outside.</p>

            <li>Someone must run in a circle with the ball in the bag to help you get it going.</li>

            <li>You see the learner swinging the ball around himself. The learner represents the Sun and the ball represents the Earth. If you look carefully at the rubber bands, you can see that the ball is pulling on the learner, and the learner is pulling on the ball.</li>

                  <p>Give learners time to think about this. The answer is that the ball will continue travelling in the direction it was going at the moment the string broke. Learners can test this answer by letting the string go.</p>

        <p>Now in Space, the Earth keeps on going around the Sun at more than 100 000 kilometres per hour. But there is no string pulling on the Earth, so what pulls on the Earth?</p>
        
        <p>Gravity force pulls the Sun and the Earth towards each other.</p>
        
        <p>There is no string in Space between the Earth and Sun! The Sun pulls on the Earth and the Earth pulls on the Sun with the forces of gravity. The pull is so strong that it works at a distance of 150 million kilometres! Like the string, gravity force keeps the Earth moving in its orbit around the Sun, year after year.</p>

Part of the reason is that plants can grow on Earth, and we need plants to survive.</p>

                  <p>Here the learners must make a hypothesis. We do not know the answer but we can make a hypothesis that the pale green leaves grew in the dark. Another hypothesis could be: some insects were sucking juice from that branch so the leaves were weak. The second answer is not wrong and you should praise learners who think of more than one hypothesis. You are developing their skill in hypothesising. However, the first hypothesis is a better one than the second hypothesis.</p>
